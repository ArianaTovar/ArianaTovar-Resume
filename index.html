        <div class="subheading mb-5">Editor and English MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a student attending the University of California Riverside as an English major, studying a wide range of literature.  I have and am currently learning how to analyze literature and understanding the different techniques and themes that makes different genres of literature successful.  For example, I have studied childrenâ€™s books, mystery and crime fiction, and American Literature.  I also have studied various topics of literature, such as disability and critical race theory, which helps in understanding the wider perspective on literatureâ€™s impact and how that should be carefully considered in the future.  I, additionally, have a particular knowledge of older English works, such as Old and Middle English poems, and am able to read in those languages, which helps with a more thorough knowledge of the basis of myths and legends.  I am also learning both Japanese and ASL, with a current ability to understand and translate simple sentences in both.<br><br>

        Additionally, I am a current editor and publishing assistant for Belle Lune Books.  My job involves editing and proofreading children and young adult books, while maintaining a good and transparent relationship with various authors.  I always try to ensure that the authors are aware of any changes that must be made and why they are necessary, while still allowing them to have final say over any key story or plot points.  My job is to ensure they have the best version of their work they can have; not rewrite their story and I try to ensure that I am doing so to the best of my abilities.  Additionally, I attend various book fairs for the company to sell products, promote the authors, and promote upcoming titles.  I assist authors in signings and try to create an environment that allows them and their fans to get the most out of every event.  Further, I search for various partners, artists, and collaborators to ensure the authors can have the type of book that they envision.  This may include understanding an artistâ€™s ability and limitations that way I can make the best match possible for certain works. <br><br>

        Overall, I have a passion for literature, dedicating my professional career to books of all types.  However, I have additional hobbies that surround the arts and can have additional application in my field such as; sewing, drawing, and model making.  I can sew various type of garments and have an understanding of how different fabric and patterns can make certain types of outfits.  This can be helpful when working with fantasy books that require unique clothing as understanding how an outfit is made can have a centering ground of realism.  My ability to draw can be useful when working with childrenâ€™s books, which tend to lean into a visual aspect, and is helpful for smaller icons necessary at the beginning of chapters.  My ability to make models includes a spatial understanding, which can be helpful in maintaining a roomâ€™s limitations and uses.  This can be applied in cases of mystery novels, in which spatial awareness in often necessary for constructing hidden doors and passageways.
